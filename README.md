# _Hi There!_
I decided it was about time to update this Github profile and make it look somewhat professional.
Most of the projects on here are unfinished but the most complete (and my favourite) is my PTZ-Optics camera controller that I built using HTML CSS and JS.
Go check it out [here](https://www.github.com/j-trueman/PTZ-Optics)
